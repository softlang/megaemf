# Technology models of EMF usage

Any model is constructed in a reproducible manner. The following artifacts are deployed.
* The models can be found in the folder "models". They are encoded in a visual syntax using yed.
* The textual explanations can be found in the subfolder "texts", e.g., models/CodeGeneration/texts.
* The code examples can be found in the subfolder "code", where we created one .ttl file for each demo or wild project, e.g.,
  "models/CodeGeneration/code/demo-primerpo.ttl" .
  * The README documents rationales and links for reproducing the results.
* Provided tools tailored towards finding code examples or textual explanations are given in "tools".
* A copy of the qegal implementation that we have adapted can be found in the folder "tools/qegal".
