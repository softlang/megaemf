Corpus: "EMF: Eclipse Modeling Framework" by Steinberg (2008)

Types:
  - name: Ecore Model
    link: Subsection 2.3.1 The Ecore (Meta) Model
    query: "Ecore+model" in table of contents
    rationale: Explains what an Ecore model is and what its structural parts represent.

  - name: Generator Model
    link: Subsection 2.4.4 Generator Model
    query: "Generator model" in table of contents
    rationale: Explains that a generator model contains configuration aspects.

  - name: Interface
    link: Subsection 2.4.1 Generated Model Classes
    query: "Generated" in table of contents (the interface is a model class)
    rationale: Explains that an interface is generated and that it is a subtype of EObject.

  - name: Interface Implementation
    link: Subsection 2.4.1 Generated Model Classes
    query: "Generated" in table of contents (the interface implementation implements the interface as identified above)
    rationale: Explains that a respective interface implementation is also generated.

  - name: Adapter Factory
    link: Subsection 2.4.2 Other Generated "Stuff"
    query:
      - "Generated" in table of contents
      - "Adapter Factory" in 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 leads to more relevant explanations in 2.4.2
    rationale: Explains what the skeleton Adapter Factory is used for.

Relations:
  - name: Create Generator Model
    link: Subsection 2.4.4 Generator Model
    query: "Generator Model" in table of content
    rationale: Explains that the generator model refers to and decorates the Ecore model with the code generation config.

  - name: Create Generator Model
    link: Subsection 12.4.4 Ecore2GenModel
    query: "Ecore+genmodel" in table of content (.genmodel is the file extension for a generator model)
    rationale: Explains the process artifact which creates the generator model based on an Ecore model.

  - name: Generate Java Code
    link: Subsection 2.4.1 Generated Model Classes
    query: "Generated"
    rationale: Explains that Java interfaces as well as their implementations are generated.

  - name: Generate Java Code
    link: Subsection 2.4.2 Other Generated "Stuff"
    query:
      - "Generated" in table of content
      - "Adapter Factory" in 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 leads to more relevant explanations in 2.4.2
    rationale: Explains that an adapter factory is generated, e.g., POAdapterFactory.

  - name: Generate Java Code
    link: Subsection 12.4.5 Generator
    query:
      - "Generator" (as part of the term generator model)
    rationale: Explains the process artifact which executes the code generation.
