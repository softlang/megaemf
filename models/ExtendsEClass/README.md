# Examplifying misconception

The model depicts that a generated Java class extends the class EClass instead of EObject.

We aim for capturing models that show idiomatic usage of EMF. Hence, no proper textual explanations and code examples useful for explaining EMF to a developer can be found.

By this, we do not intend to challenge any research that is dedicated to exploring extensions of Ecore and thus an implementation of the EMOF. Research can be found on this.

A discussion can be found in the paper.
